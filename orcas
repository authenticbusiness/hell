The Peninsula Valdes Orcas like to come right onto the sand to snatch baby seals and sea lions off the beach. They literally catch a wave in, stranding themselves in the process, and attempt to grab newborn seals and sea lions.
I imagined I would see an orca eating a baby sea lion, or a baby seal on my 10th wedding anniversary.
