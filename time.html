        <p>This is your place so I will keep it brief. A place for your writing, to document your ceramics. A place to practice, publish, to hide, to ritualize. You have so much to put down, let go, exorcise. It can all go here, or it could be a place away from all of that. You're an editor at heart. In any case where you write and edit is where you are. And that's where I want to be.</p>

        <p>This was supposed to be a sanity blog and it will be, in time. All our thoughts are supposed to be organized with sanity. I'll try to wrap my head around it, but until thenâ€¦</p>
        
        <p>You've been so patient with me for so long. Everything I do without a calendar. Time is a circle like a ring. I want to replace yours, but it feels so much more literary buried at the bottom of the ocean. In time I'll get you this Cartier 1895 wedding band, yellow gold, set with a diamond. Now I've said too much, too literally.</p>
        
        <p>Another circle, another loop, another ring, another time, another ten. With you, always. At this beach at the end of the world with the whales, or at our beach with the horseshoe crabs at the beginning of time.</p>
